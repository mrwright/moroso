Moroso
======

Moroso is a project to create a full stack for a simple (but not *too* simple) game. This includes a CPU (with our own instruction set), our own programming language, our own compiler for it, our own operating system for that CPU, and our own Doom-like game running on it.

The most up-to-date information will be on the [https://github.com/mrwright/moroso/wiki](Wiki).
